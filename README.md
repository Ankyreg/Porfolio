Hello! My name is Katya and I am a beginner Java developer. This repository contains projects that I completed as part 
of an online course on Java development. Here you will find my first steps in the world of programming and see my 
progress in learning various concepts.

My portfolio is divided into three main categories, each representing a key area in learning Java.
