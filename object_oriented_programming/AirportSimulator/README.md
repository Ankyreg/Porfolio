## Airport Simulator
### The simplest airport simulator. The airport contains 4 terminals, each of which contains from 100 to 125 aircraft. For each aircraft (except for those that went to the parking lot), a flight is created: time, type (departure / arrival). The program has three functions:
#### 1) Display the entire schedule for each terminal for the next 24 hours; 
#### 2) Display of all flight types for the specified nearest hours;
#### 3) Display of the specified type of flight for the specified nearest hours.
