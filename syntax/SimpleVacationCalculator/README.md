#Simple Vacation Calculator
#####This program is for fictional production. Two shifts are assigned to each workshop for some time. Each of the employees can go on vacation strictly every six months for two weeks. When two employees are appointed as each other's alternates, their holidays must not overlap. Holidays are also set for the entire production. If someone's vacation intersects with holidays, then additional days off are added to the vacation, depending on the number of holidays that intersect with the vacation. 
#####The program has two functions:
##### 1. prints all the days off of an employee before a given date.
##### 2. checks the intersection of vacation days of two shifts and, in case of intersection, shifts these days, taking into account the holidays (if there is an overlap). The employee whose vacation is first according to the schedule goes on vacation first. The vacation of the second employee is shifted.
