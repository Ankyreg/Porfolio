##The simple customer database
###A program for manually adding unique clients to the database. If one of the contacts (email or phone) already exists in the database, a new account is not created, it is proposed to restore the existing one. There is also a feature to automatically add customers from a third-party small list. If the third-party list has a familiar contact email or phone, the account is not added. User names can be the same.
